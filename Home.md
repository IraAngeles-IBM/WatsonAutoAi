# Watson Studio

## AutoAI tutorial: Build a binary classification model

This tutorial guides you through training a model to predict whether or not a customer is likely to buy a tent from an outdoor equipment store. In this tutorial, you will create an AutoAI experiment in IBM Watson Studio to build a model that analyzes your data and selects the best model type and estimators to produce, train, and optimize pipelines, which are model candidates. After reviewing the pipelines, you will save one as a model, deploy it, then test it to get a prediction.
