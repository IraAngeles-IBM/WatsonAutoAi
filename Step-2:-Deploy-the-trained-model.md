Before you can use your trained model to make predictions on new data, you must deploy the model.

You can deploy the model from the model details page. You can access the model details page in one of these ways:

* Clicking on the model name in the notification displayed when you save the model. 
* Open the **Assets** page for the project containing the model and click the model name in the Machine Learning Model section. 

From the model details page:

* Click the **Deployments** tab. 
* Click **Add Deployment**. 
* In the page that opens, fill in the fields: 
  * Specify a name for the deployment. 
  * Select “Web service” as the **Deployment type**. 
  * Click **Save**. 

After you save the deployment, click on the deployment name to view the deployment details page.
